<p class="intro">
  I'm from a northern part of Indiana, but currently reside in the city of Indianapolis. I enjoy all aspects of web design, web development, and multiple different forms of marketing.
  One of my favorite things about working in these departments is the customization I am able to do and the communication I am able to have to clients and customers. That being said, I want to help your business grow.
  I'm not only talking grow in gross, but also grow your client base, your email list, your page views, and the like.
