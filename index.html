<h1 class="header"> Hi, I'm Courtney Recker. </h1>

<h2 class="intro"> It's nice to meet you!</h2>

<p class="intro">
  <p>I&#8217;m a 21 year-old self-taught developer and photographer currently residing in Indianapolis, Indiana. Currently my expertise is in HTML and CSS. Basic I know, but bare with me. Javascript is on my list next to master. Apart from practicing my skills during my free time, I attend Arizona State Online to obtain a degree in Graphic Information Technology (aka web development/design). I&#8217;m obsessed with coffee and beer and I would rather be at a live concert than at work. I have a cat named Boots and I&#8217;m engaged to the man of my dreams.

  Journey with me as my skills develop and let&#8217;s see where life takes us. Shall we?</p>
