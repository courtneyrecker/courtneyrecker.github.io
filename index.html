    <h1>Hi! I’m Courtney. </h1>
<h3>I’m a 21 year-old self-taught developer and photographer currently residing in Indianapolis, Indiana. Currently my expertise is in HTML and CSS. Basic I know, but bare with me. Javascript is on my list next to master. Apart from practicing my skills during my free time, I attend Arizona State Online to obtain a degree in Graphic Information Technology (aka web development/design). I’m obsessed with coffee and beer and I would rather be at a live concert than at work. I have a cat named Boots and I’m engaged to the man of my dreams. Journey with me as my skills develop and let’s see where life takes us. Shall we?</h3>
What can I help you with? 
<p>I love creating a great website for the right people. I want to get to know you as more than just a client. Your website needs to represent your brand and the aesthetic that you are trying to present. I would love to help be apart of your journey. Whether it be social media management, web development, or if you just need some consulting- I can assist with it all. Reach out to me if you think we would pair well together. I invite you to ingage with me on social media as well. </p>
